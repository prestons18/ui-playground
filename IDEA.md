## UI Playground - The Plan

My idea for this is a **Figma-like interface** (using `preston-ui`).

(My UI library is currently similar to ShadCN under the hood, but this **wonâ€™t** be the case for much longer.)

### **What do I want to create?**

- A **Figma-inspired UI** where components from `preston-ui` can be **dragged, resized, positioned, and styled** effortlessly.
- A **developer-friendly design system** that displays the **exact class names, properties, and configurations** of components in real time.
- A **fully interactive playground** for testing, refining, and experimenting with UI components before integrating them into a web application.
- A **storybook-driven API** for dynamically loading components, styles, and themes, ensuring seamless real-time updates.

=> This wonâ€™t just benefit my own codebaseâ€”it has the potential to help many others as well. Thatâ€™s why I plan to **add custom library support** in the future. ðŸš€

## UI Playground - The Plan

My idea for this is a **Figma-like interface** ~~(using `preston-ui`)~~ _Using tailwind for now._

### **What do I want to create?**

- A **Figma-inspired UI** where components from **any component library** can be **dragged, resized, positioned, and styled** effortlessly.

- A **developer-friendly design system** that displays the **exact class names, properties, and configurations** of components in real time.

- A **fully interactive playground** for testing, refining, and experimenting with UI components before integrating them into a web application.

> This wonâ€™t just benefit my own codebaseâ€”it has the potential to help many others as well. ðŸš€
